# homeroom

HOMEROOM is an application to help students and teachers in Kyrgyzstan transition to online schooling during COVID-19 crisis.

This project is one of my initial Node projects, a product of 1.5 week of hard work with special meaning to me and my younger siblings, who encountered problems with homeschooling.

FEATURES: 

  1. Add Topics:
  
    The primary goal of the application is to enable teachers to upload materials to relevant lessons. Within each lesson there is a feature that helps add a topic
    Once it is added, homework files, meeting urls and lecture notes can be uploaded for students to download. Also, teachers can edit or delete the topic in case of 
    errors.
      
  2. User Authentification:
     
     The application requires registration and login information for users to access materials. This feature is added in order to separate different cohorts 
     and schools that will be added in future versions.
